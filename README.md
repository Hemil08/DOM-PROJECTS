**--> DOM Manipulation Tasks <--**

This repository demonstrates various DOM manipulation techniques using JavaScript. Each task focuses on implementing a specific functionality to dynamically interact with HTML elements.

Features

1. Change the Text Content

Task: A button changes the text of a paragraph when clicked.

Implementation: A JavaScript event listener updates the textContent property of the paragraph.

2. Toggle Visibility

Task: A button toggles the visibility of a div element.

Implementation: The style.display property is used to show or hide the div element.

3. Change Background Color

Task: A button changes the background color of the page or a specific div element.

Implementation: The style.backgroundColor property is dynamically updated.

4. Add a New List Item

Task: A button adds a new item to an unordered list (<ul>).

Implementation: New <li> elements are created using document.createElement and appended to the <ul> using appendChild.

5. Remove a List Item

Task: A button next to each list item removes that item when clicked.

Implementation: Each <li> includes a button that triggers the removeChild method on the parent <ul>.

6. Display Input Value

Task: An input field and a button display the value of the input in a paragraph when clicked.

Implementation: The value property of the input field is retrieved and displayed in the paragraph.

7. Image Slider

Task: Two buttons ("Next" and "Previous") switch between different images.

Implementation: The src attribute of an <img> element is updated to show the next or previous image in an array.

8. Character Counter

Task: A textarea displays the number of characters typed in real-time.

Implementation: The input event updates a counter displaying the length of the value in the textarea.

9. Change Font Size

Task: A button increases or decreases the font size of a paragraph.

Implementation: The style.fontSize property is incremented or decremented.

10. Create a To-Do List

Task: An input field and an "Add" button add items to a list. Items can be removed when clicked.

Implementation: The createElement, appendChild, and removeChild methods are used to manage the list dynamically.
